- Book Search: Lets you search for books by title, author, or publisher to make it easy to find specific information.

## Technologies Used

- JavaEE: Platform for developing corporate applications in Java.

- Servlets: Java components that run on a web server to process HTTP requests.

- JSP (JavaServer Pages): Technology that allows the creation of dynamic web pages, mixing Java code with HTML.

- JDBC (Java Database Connectivity): Java API for database connection, used to perform data persistence operations.

- Relational Database: Use a relational database (eg MySQL, PostgreSQL) to store book information.

- PrimeFaces: Component library for developing user interfaces (UI) based on JavaServer Faces (JSF). It offers a wide range of reusable and customizable components to facilitate the creation of rich user interfaces.

- itext: Library for creating and manipulating PDF documents in Java.

- Apache POI: Library for handling Microsoft Office files (eg Word, Excel) in Java.

- XMLBeans: Framework for generating XML binaries from XML schemas.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- JDK (Java Development Kit) 8 or higher.
- Application Server compatible with JavaEE, such as Apache Tomcat.
- Relational Database (eg MySQL) and appropriate connection settings.

## Installation and Configuration

1. Clone the repository on your local machine.

2. Import the project into your favorite IDE (eg Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA) as an existing Maven project.

3. Configure the database connection in the `persistence.xml` file.

4. Start the application server and deploy the project.
